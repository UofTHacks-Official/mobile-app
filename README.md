# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Getting Started: Project Initialization & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Expo CLI (optional but recommended):**
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- **Expo Go app**: Install on your mobile device ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent))
- **iOS Simulator**: Requires Xcode (macOS only)
- **Android Emulator**: Requires Android Studio

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
```bash
npx expo start
```
This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser. You can:
- Press `i` to open in iOS Simulator (macOS only)
- Press `a` to open in Android Emulator
- Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your device

### 4. Project Structure
- Main code lives in the **app** directory
- Uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/): files in `app/` become routes

### 5. Start Fresh (Optional)
To reset the project and start with a blank app directory:
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
